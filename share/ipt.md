### VertNet uses the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) to host published biodiversity data on the VertNet IPT for its participating institutions. Are you an aspiring VertNet data publisher but are unsure about IPT and your hosting options? Take a look at answers to frequently asked questions, below.

## IPT FAQ

### What is the Integrated Publishing Toolkit?

The IPT is a free, open source web application designed to publish primary occurrence data, species checklists and taxonomies, and associated dataset metadata available for use on the Internet. Data are published as web-based Darwin Core Archives (simple ZIP files that contain tab-delimited or comma-separated text files organized using the Darwin Core Standard). The IPT is used by a growing number of data portals and aggregators globally. It was developed and is maintained by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) with significant support from the broad informatics community, including VertNet.

To learn more about the IPT, it’s key features, and technical attributes, please visit GBIF’s IPT page.

### Why let VertNet host our data for us?

VertNet can either host your data on our IPT, or you can host it yourself with VertNet support. The VertNet-hosted option eliminates the need for you to maintain a server. Hosting your own IPT would allow your institution to publish more than vertebrate records, but VertNet can do that for you as well. In either case, you retain control over all of your data (see #6 below). To help you decide, please take a look at the simple flowchart we’ve put together. Whatever you choose, members of the VertNet team will help you to get everything set up and ready to go.

### How much control do we have over what is published?

You decide what to publish and how often you update your data set(s). VertNet does not claim any ownership of your data. You will have the opportunity to apply any waivers and terms of use to your data set(s) prior to publication — a VertNet team member will discuss this with you when we begin your transition to IPT.

Data for an entire organization can be published in one data set, or in data sets specific to independently curated collections. From the perspective of VertNet, we prefer that records from vertebrates are independent of records from other taxa. When we begin working with you to publish via IPT, we will discuss the details of the best way to accommodate the needs of your organization.

### What are we committing to when we publish our data?

The expectations for participation in the VertNet data portal remain the same as they have been since MaNIS was created in 2001.

As a VertNet data publisher you are making a commitment to:
  - Maintain an accessible repository of high-quality specimen data.
  - Provide terms of use for these publicly accessible data.
  - Provide accompanying metadata about the collection.
  - Register your organization and data resources with GBIF so that users, search engines and portals can locate your data access point.

### Will my data be searchable in a data portal?

Yes, your data will be available and searchable via the VertNet and GBIF data portals. We will harvest the data from the appropriate IPT instance and make it available for visualization and analysis, just as we do right now. The classic networks (MaNIS/HerpNET/ORNIS) portals will continue to serve your data until May 2014, at which time they will no longer be maintained. FishNet will continue to provide service to the community into the foreseable future.

If you serve your data to other data portals, and those portals can harvest data from an IPT, your data will continue to be available via those services. If those other portals require a DiGIR provider, you will need to continue to maintain your local DiGIR server to continue your connection to those services.

### How often do we need to update our data?

The frequency with which you update your data is entirely up to you. Many update on a monthly basis. Lots of others update whenever they have accumulated enough new data or updated legacy data. Establishing a direct database link to the VertNet IPT can make the process very easy, but not all databases can be linked directly. Let us know if you are interested and we can explore all of the possibilities together.

### How much does it cost to use the VertNet IPT?

Use of the VertNet IPT is free and will cost you nothing. Nada. Zero. Zip. We are happy to accept home-baked goods in exchange for this service - cookies, muffins, cinnamon rolls and the like.
