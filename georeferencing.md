Georeferencing is an important part of the VertNet project and an essential component of data completeness and fitness for use of every occurrence record. To promote the best practices in georeferencing, we’ve developed an extensive collection of tools and resources and conducted many workshops around the world.

We’ve created Georeferencing.org along with our friends at GEOLocate and iDigBio’s Georeferencing Working Group to share the most useful and current georeferencing resources and training materials available.
