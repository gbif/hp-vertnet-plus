## Datasets

Sometimes you just need all the data, so we created these taxon-based data snapshots from the VertNet Index. Together, these datasets represent the entirety of the content within the VertNet data portal at a given point in time. Our goal is to update these snapshots quarterly. They will be made available to the public via [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/) on their [Data Commons Repository](https://cyverse.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DC/overview). We’ll also keep our first set of snapshots up on the [KNB Data Repository](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), a [member repository of DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/network/#list-of-member-repositories). Both CyVerse and KNB will provide a persistent home for these datasets and mint a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) (digital object identifier), so that you can refer to the dataset by name or by DOI, just like you would a publication.
